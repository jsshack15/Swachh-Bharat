<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (English: Clean India Mission and abbreviated as SBA or SBM for "Swachh Bharat Mission") is a national campaign by the Government of India, covering 4,041 statutory cities and towns, to clean the streets, roads and infrastructure of the country.[1][2][3]
The campaign was officially launched on 2 October 2014 at Rajghat, New Delhi, where Prime Minister Narendra Modihimself cleaned the road. Modi said that the best memorial to Mahatma Gandhi would be to achieve a "Clean India" by 2019, his 150th birth anniversary. It is India's biggest ever cleanliness drive and 3 million government employees and school and college students of India participated in this event.[4][5] The mission was started by Prime Minister Modi, who nominated nine famous personalities for the campaign, and they took up the challenge and nominated nine more people and so on. It has been carried forward since then with people from all walks of life joining it.
